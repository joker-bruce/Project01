A sunny day, you walked on the road and a man suddenly went into your way and ask you to match the pattern "asdfghjk" or he would kill you. You start to think which pattern matches "asdfghjk".


As much as I tried to come up with an answer, I couldn't think of a pattern. So what I did was, I looked straight into his eyes and smiled, "Me sorry, I no English, English". I waved good bye, patted him on the back and countinued to walk down the street.


Then you waked up from your dream. And on your way to school, a man suddenly stopped you...

You think of your dream, and you quickly answered: "Me...sorry! No English...Me want go!"
The man looked at you strangely and speak slowly: "Are you ok? Actually, I am your professor.""Hi...Professor..."
